# Healthcare Prediction Project

### Overview

This project aims to predict healthcare outcomes using a combination of exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning models. The project achieves an impressive 99% accuracy with an error rate of less than 5% using Linear Regression and XGBoost models. Additionally, a web application was developed using Streamlit and deployed on Streamlit Cloud for easy accessibility.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
	•	Analyzed the dataset to identify trends, patterns, and outliers.
	•	Visualized distributions and relationships between features using graphs and charts.

### Data Cleaning
	•	Handled missing and null values.
	•	Standardized data formats for consistency.
	•	Removed redundant or irrelevant data.

### Feature Engineering
	•	Selected relevant features using correlation analysis.
	•	Identified and addressed multicollinearity using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF).
	•	Scaled features using StandardScaler for optimal model training.

### Model Training and Evaluation
	•	Models used:
	•	Linear Regression
	•	XGBoost
	•	Achieved:
	•	Model Accuracy: 99%
	•	Error Rate: <5%
	•	Fine-tuned the XGBoost model to maximize performance.

### Web Application
	•	Live Demo: https://ml-project-healthcare-prediction-gokulb.streamlit.app
	•	Features of the app:
	•	Input user data to get dynamic predictions.
	•	Visualizations and insights for better understanding.

### Deployment
	•	Deployed the web application on Streamlit Cloud.
	•	Accessible to users with a seamless and intuitive experience.
       

## Conclusion

The project successfully demonstrates the use of machine learning in healthcare prediction. The high accuracy and low error rate showcase the robustness of the models, and the Streamlit-based web application makes it accessible to a broader audience.
